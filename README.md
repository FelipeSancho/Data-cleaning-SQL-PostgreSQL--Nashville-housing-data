# Data cleaning SQL (PostgreSQL) - Nashville housing data

## In this repository you will find the excel file that I imported to PostgreSQL and a file containing the SQL queries.

This project focuses on data cleaning tasks performed using SQL queries in PostgreSQL. The dataset used is related to Nashville housing information. The cleaning operations include:

-Populating missing property addresses based on parcel IDs.
-Breaking down property addresses into individual columns for address and city.
-Splitting owner addresses into separate columns for address, city, and state.
-Standardizing "Sold as vacant" values to "Yes" and "No".
-Removing duplicate entries based on specific criteria.
